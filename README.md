## Description 

  This project was created as a utility for anyone who wants to record notes on any of their devices. For the time being notes are only saved to the device they were created on, but in the future I hope to allow notes to be save and viewed across different devices. 

## Installation 

  Installation is simple, as it is a web based application you can access the Note Maker by visiting [](https://). 

## Usage 

  Once youve opened up the [link to the web application](https://), you will land on the homepage. Press the button that appears in the centre of the screen to proceed. On the next page any previously generated notes will be displayed on the left side and a section on the left side of the screen to enter a new note. You may also click on one of the existing notes to pull up its contents. The red garbage can icon beside the existing notes is used to delete a note from the list. Be careful you don't delete anything important.
